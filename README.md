# Impact of COVID-19 on unemployment rate in INDIA
The Covid-19 pandemic has hit every country, every economy in a bad way. Many people lost their friends and relatives, but far more of them has been pushed to near death situation due to loss of livelihood. Unemployment rate has increased drastically since the start of the pandemic.
I have build a dashboard by using Power BI on dataset contains the Unemployment rate in India from 2019-2021.
I have taken data from https://unemploymentinindia.cmie.com
